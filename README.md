### Learning Python

If you're just looking to learn python, there's a ton of resources out there.
I started with codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python
Automate the boring stuff: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

### Learning Pandas

For pandas, the statistical package for python, I started here:
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/tutorials.html
I did the 10 minutes to Pandas, cookbook and others

Greg Ruda helped me get started with pandas: http://gregreda.com/blog/

This was a great video tutorial, with materials: https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial

This looks like a good tutorial series: https://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1.html

This looks like an interesting comparison of plotting techniques: http://pythonplot.com/

This is Seaborn's documentation: http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html
